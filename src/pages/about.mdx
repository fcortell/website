# A little about me

Hello world! I am Fermín, a Senior Software Engineer currently contributing to the [digitalization branch of BASF SE](https://www.basf.com/es/es/who-we-are/digitalization.html), a German chemical company. Born in Alcoy, Alicante.

## Professional Landscape

In my role as a Senior Software Engineer, I am deeply engaged in the complex ecosystem of the digitalization branch at BASF SE. Here, I'm mainly focused on Microsoft technologies (.NET Framework).

## Adherence to Software Development Best Practices

My professional ethos is anchored in the principles of clean code, clean architecture, and the SOLID principles. Recognizing the significance of maintainability and scalability, I adhere to these best practices to ensure that the solutions crafted are not only functional but also robust and sustainable over time.

## Technological Enthusiasm

My interest in emerging technologies extends to artificial intelligence and machine learning, areas where innovation converges with practical application. Staying abreast of advancements in these fields is not merely a professional obligation but a genuine passion for pushing the boundaries of what technology can achieve.

## Integration of Nature and Technology

Outside the confines of code, I find solace in 4x4 adventures and the serenity of the great outdoors. Alongside my wife and our trio of loyal dogs - two Golden Retrievers and a Belgian Malinois - we traverse trails, chase sunsets, and enjoy the little things in life.

## Authorial Pursuits and Mental Health Advocacy

My recent endeavor, the publication of "TOCado, pero no hundido," reflects a commitment to addressing the nuanced landscapes of mental health. Rooted in personal observations, this work seeks to bridge the persons suffering this mental disorder with the rest of the world, in an effort to be understood.
